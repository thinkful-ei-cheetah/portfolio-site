          <p>
            My full name is Michael Verdi and I’m a builder at heart and love creating software that solves real world problems. I grew up in Baltimore, but have since lived in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC and Singapore.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            My path to programming is a bit different from your average coder.  I graduated with a degree in Entrepreneurship because I believe businesses can change the world.  I saw software as a means to an end, a super power for building products and services that help people.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Over the course of six months, I taught myself enough to be dangerous and got a job as a Ruby on Rails developer for (at the time) LivingSocial and then New Relic.  I learned the importance of shipping code early and often, writing tests and communicating frequently with all involved stakeholders.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            During my time at New Relic, an opportunity emerged for me to start my own business.  Although it wasn’t in software, I took the leap and partnered with a college friend to start Cigar City CrossFit in Tampa.  Over the course of three years, I built the business from $0 to $26k in average monthly revenue.  Running a CrossFit gym taught me the importance of prioritization, customer service and community building.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Ultimately, I decided to sell the business in early 2019 because I love software.  No longer just a means to an end, I love working in code day in and day out.  Although I still strongly value delivering real business value, I find I am happiest when I see a beautifully encapsulated class with well-named methods and a test suite to boot!
